# Orders-Management
This application is created for processing client orders for a warehouse.
Relational databases should be used to store the products, the clients, and the orders. The application should be designed according to the Layered Architecture Pattern.

## Requirements
IntelliJ IDEA

## Usage
### Requirements
Relational databases should be used to store the products, the clients, and the orders. The 
application should be designed according to the layered architecture pattern and should use 
(minimally) the following classes: Model classes, Business Logic classes, Presentation classes â€“ GUI related classes, Data access classes.

### Implementation
In programming, the Business Logic Layer (BLL) serves as an intermediary for data exchange between the presentation and the Data Access Layer (DAL). BLL manages the rules, calculations, and logic within an application that dictate how it behaves. That is, the BLL determines how the data in the database is used and what can and cannot be done within the application.

In software, a Data access object (DAO) is a model that provides an abstract interface to a type of database or other persistence mechanism. By mapping application calls, the DAO provides some specific data operations without exposing the database details.
